Algorithm 1: 

Calculate Highest Marks

Function markHighest(marks):
 Set highest to first mark
  For each mark starting from second:
    If mark > highest then
     Set highest to mark
EndIf
    End For
    Return highest
End Function

Calculate Lowest Marks

Function markLowest(marks):
    Set lowest to first mark
    For each mark starting from second:
        If mark < lowest:
            Set lowest to mark
	EndIf
    End For
    Return lowest
End Function
