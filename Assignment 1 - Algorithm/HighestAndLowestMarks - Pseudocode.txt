Algorithm 1: Calculate Highest And Lowest Marks 

Input: Input array of marks (Marks) 
Output: Show Highest and lowest marks among all the array of marks (highest, lowest)

Set highest to Marks[0] 
Set Lowest to Marks[0]


For each Mark in Marks starting from the second element do
    If Mark > highest then
        Set highest to Mark
    EndIf

    If Mark < lowest then
        Set lowest to Mark
    EndIf
EndFor

Print "Highest Mark among all marks: " + highest
Print "Lowest Mark among all marks: " + lowest
