Algorithm 2: 

Calculate Mean Pseudocode

Function calcMean(marks):
    Set totalSum to 0
    For each mark in marks:
        Add mark to totalSum
    End For
    Divide totalSum by number of mark to get mean
    Return mean
End Function


Calculate Standard Deviation Pseudocode

Function calcStandardDeviation(marks, mean):
    Set totalSquaredDifference to 0
    For each mark in marks:
        i. Subtract mean from mark
        ii. Square the difference and add to totalSquaredDifference
    End For
    Divide totalSquaredDifference by number of marks and get variance
    Return standardDeviation
End Function

Function sqrt(number):
    Set oldEstimate to 0
    Set newEstimate to number divided by 2
    While oldEstimate is not equal to newEstimate:
        Set oldEstimate to newEstimate
        Set newEstimate to average of oldEstimate and number divided by oldEstimate
    End While
    Return newEstimate
End Function
